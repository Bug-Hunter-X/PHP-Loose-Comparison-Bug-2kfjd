This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: the misuse of loose comparison (`==`) instead of strict comparison (`===`). The `bug.php` file showcases code that uses loose comparison, leading to incorrect results. The `bugSolution.php` file provides the corrected code using strict comparison.  Understanding this difference is critical for writing robust and reliable PHP applications.
